# Dependencies and Libraries

## Dependency
* Note the vocabulary definition
  * Simply: My software needs other software to do its job
* Why would I depend on other software?
  * Well, more on that later
* Slight expansion on typical term
  * Dependencies are also components in the environment
    * A database or backing store
    * A web service
    * A translation service
  * Anything that your software needs to operate
* Creates a link in functionality
  
* Ways that this is brought into my code

## Libraries
Dependency hell

## Vocabulary
* *Dependency* - A loose term when a piece of software relies on another piece of software to function.
* *Coupling* - the degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are; the strength of the relationships between modules.

# Community models

* Shared from least to greatest community "factor"
* For each one...
  * When is it right?
  * Challenges
  * Examples
* What is governance?

# Models
* Dump and run
  * When code is produced and tossed somewhere...
    * Not actively developed
    * No intent to build a community around it
    * Not watched for issues/bugs
    * User/code feedback not welcome or ignored
    * More or less a dead project
  * When is it right?
    * Just get the code out there
    * Basic utility code
  * Challenges
    * If the code is great or useful, contributions don't make it back in
    * Without a driving "critical mass" of interested devs...
      * The code gets copied to several repos for individual intent
      * No "one" place exists for improvements
      * Feedback has nowhere to go
    * Impossible to create a community without a fork
    * Dead projects are bad juju!
  * Examples
    * gist postings
    * MOST GitHub/SourceForge/etc projects
* Lone wolf
  * A project maintained by one person
    * May or may not be actively developed
    * Feedback is welcomed in some way
    * Common on GitHub/SourceForge/etc
    * Generally not enough "critical mass" for a community
  * When is it right?
    * Project is small
    * Desire to BEGIN a community
    * Individual still wants to assert some sort of control
      * Project direction
      * Branding
  * Challenges
    * It's hard for one person to keep up if the project becomes popular
    * High risk of project dying if the individual...
      * gets busy with life
      * loses interest
      * walks away
      * does not foster a growing community
    * There may be no intent to create a community
    * Sometimes individuals have trouble letting go of control
  * Examples
    * TeX from history lecture
      * Branding note in license
* Open Source, closed governance
  * A living project still controlled by a single point
    * A step up from lone wolf
    * Often maintained by a single "entity"
    * Effort is made to SHOW that it isn't just "one person"
    * Often much higher community involvement
    * Common with companies who open their code
      * Still want to control direction
      * Want to focus on specific features
    * The "entity" may actually be...
      * A single person in a company, but shrouded by the company
      * A delivery team in a company
      * An entire department of a company
      * An entire company
  * When is it right?
    * Same as lone wolf, plus...
    * Project is the foundation for a bigger project
      * This isn't the service I provide, but is required by it
      * Other projects depend on this one
  * Challenges
    * Community direction is still "owned" by a central point
    * Some view this model as a less-than-open model
      * Idealism comes into play
      * But the code is open, and that IS good
    * The "entity" can take the project any direction
      * Whether the community likes it or not
      * A fork is an option, but forks still suck
    * The "entity" can be torn between their goals and the community
  * Examples
    * Netflix Open Source
      * Lots of tools/utilities that Netflix controls
      * The code isn't making them money, but it sure is driving their business
      * ACTIVE community participation (feedback is WELCOME)
* Paid membership/Invite only
  * When is it right?
  * Challenges
  * Examples
* All volunteers (open code AND governance)
  * When is it right?
  * Challenges
  * Examples

# Licenses

* First, some important terms (know them)
  * Free software
    * "Software that can be freely shared and modified, including in source code form"
    * Coined by FSF
    * "Free" ambiguity
      * Acceptable ambiguity to emphasize FREEDOM
  * Open Source
    * Coined by OSI
    * "goal at the time was largely to make such software a more palatable choice for corporations, by presenting it as a development methodology rather than as a political movement."
    * AKA: ...people in ties
  * Other terms:
    * OSS - Open Source Software
    * FOSS - Free/Open Source Software
    * FLOSS - Free/Libre Open Source Software
    * DFSG-Compliant
      * A note about Debian
      * Large amount of work went into definition of criteria
      * You KNOW that it is "free" if compliant
    * OSI-approved
      * Similar concept above
      * List maintained by OSI
    * FSF list
      * "Free" or not
      * Also GPL compatible or not
  * Proprietary or closed source
    * Important distinction
      * IS NOT whether the source can be seen
      * IS a matter of what you can do with the source
    * Proprietary code...
      * May be licensed without source being available
      * May have source available, but NO rights to modify or redistribute
  * Copyleft
    * Open Source that is licensed such that derivatives must also be Open
    * Also called 'viral'
  * Permissive
    * Open Source license that does NOT restrict derivatives
    * Still "free"
* Aspects of licenses
  * Nearly all say...
    * Anyone can modify the code
    * Anyone can redistribute it both in original and modified form
    * The copyright holders and authors provide no warranties whatsoever
  * Differences
    * Compatibility with proprietary licenses
      * Permissive allows incorporating into proprietary works
    * Compatibility with other Free licenses
    * Enforcement of attribution
    * Trademark protection
    * Patent protection
      * Copyrighter includes patent license rights with contribution
      * Litigation initiation also causes LOSS of the patent rights
* The special rights of the copyright holder
  * Copyright doesn't vanish when code is open
  * Copyright still grants "ownership" of your code
    * Giving or sharing the code DOES NOT grant copyright to the recipient
    * Unless your CLA grants copyright to the receiving project as part of your contribution
  * Copyright grants decision rights for distribution
  * Therefore the copyrighter...
    * CAN give the code away AND charge for it
    * CAN distribute under many terms
      * Copyleft license for the general public
      * ...but sell exceptions to paying clients
    * CAN have a free but paid component (freemium)
  * Copyright applies to OTHERS, not the copyrighter

    * Derivatives must...

      * Provide attribution
  * GPL
    * Created by FSF
    * Copyleft license
    * Has variations
      * AGPL - copyleft applies even to network usage of the code
